# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to predict the tumor is malignant or benign from the data of patients having breast cancer using a Logistic Regression Model.

## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project employs a Logistic Regression Model to assist in predicting breast cancer risk based on various input features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Logistic Regression

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from sklearn datasets. It contains various attributes related to breast cancer that will be used for prediction.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:
cmd > pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
bash $ cd breast-cancer-prediction
5. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script and run the code to see the predictions.

## Results
The model's performance and predictions are displayed in the results section of the notebook. You can analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the model based on the dataset used.
